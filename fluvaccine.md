            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
               <p>The problem was that customers were having a difficult time placing their flu vaccine orders and scheduling them when they were available online. Our call center was flooded with calls from hospitals, doctor's,  etc., because customers could not figure out how to use the online tool.  The Flu Marketing Department asked my department, the eCommerce Department,  to come up with a solution for their online flu vaccine tool. 
                  <br><br>
                  I did not have a lot of feedback from the actual users, but I had to rely on the call center and the Flu Marketing Teams feedback. I used heuristic evaluations and conducted contextual interviews with members of the call center to see how the customer was using the tool.  With any project, I place myself in the shoes of the user and build empathy for them. 
                  <br><br>
                  This allowed me to design the new Flu Vaccine Ordering tool confidently.  I knew what the pain points were and what the business is looking to achieve. I was able to quickly come up with a workflow that was intuitive and easy to use. 
                  <br><br>
                  I coded the front-end and supported the development team during the handoff.  Once, the development team completed the work; I conducted QA and Usability testing. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Within our first year of launch the redesign we saw a 2000% increase in sales and huge decrease in calls to our call center.</strong>
