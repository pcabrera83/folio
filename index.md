description:  Leading design, research, design systems, and multiple projects. As a UX designer, I've helped businesses make apps, websites and products that make sense to the people who use them. I enjoy taking difficult problems and the collaborative design process as it helps fuel my drive to improve peopleâ€™s lives through human-centered design.
