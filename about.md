               <p>Hello, Welcome! Here is where I tell you about myself. Sadly, I'm not a writer, so Lena Dunham can breathe a sigh of relief or hang her head in shame if she reads this post.<br><br>
                  Let's begin, I'm Patricio Cabrera, a multi-faceted creative working as a UX Designer in CT. I enjoy working with teams or independently, solving problems using design and UI. I've been creating and designing interactive experiences for over eight years. My passion is knowing that my work made a difference in the lives of the users who use the products I've designed.<br><br>
                  My professional career began as a graphic design intern for the CT Science Center. I followed this experience by joining McKesson in two roles. First as their eMail Marketing Designer and later as the head Web/UX designer for one of the subsidiary's, Moore Medical. As I grew more confident in my skills and my ability to quickly think on my feet, I moved on to consulting where I had the opportunity to work on a broad range of projects, thus allowing me to grow as a designer and an advocate for the user's experience.<br><br>
                  When I'm not thinking of design, I'm learning about front-end technologies. So far I delved in NPM, node.js, grunt and gulp, Pug and creating a living style guide using Fabricator. Creating a living style guide was a challenge since I had no experience working on the command line, NPM and node.js.<br><br>
                  My pastimes include running, drinking coffee, walking my dog, looking at Pinterest for fresh interior design ideas, watching the Patriots play on Sundays and listening to Marc Anthony while I work.
